# sprayFlameletFoam
This solver implements the **Flamelet Progress-Variable (FPV)** approach for modeling spray combustion in [OpenFOAM-6](https://openfoam.org/version/6/). Detailed chemical processes are mapped onto two trajectory variables, namely the mixture fraction and the progress variable.

## Installation
