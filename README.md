# sprayFlameletFoam
This solver implements the **Flamelet Progress-Variable (FPV)** approach for modeling spray combustion. Detailed chemical processes are mapped onto two trajectory variables, namely the mixture fraction and the progress variable.

## Installation
Make sure OpenFOAM-6 is installed with appropriate configuration <https://openfoam.org/version/6/>.

```bash
mkdir ~/OpenFOAM/sprayFlameletFoam/
git clone https://github.com/ZX114/sprayFlameletFoam.git ~/OpenFOAM/sprayFlameletFoam/
cd ~/OpenFOAM/sprayFlameletFoam/
./Allwmake
```
